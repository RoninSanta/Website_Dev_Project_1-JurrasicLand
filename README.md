# Website Development Project 1-JurrasicLand
A website I developed for a Jurassic Land themed amusement park when I was learning HTML and CSS.

- This is the first website I ever designed, therefore, it looks a little rough.
- There are 3 pages in total the `Home`Page, `Attractions&Facilities` Page and `Park Info` Page

  
### [Home Page]
Contains attraction information about the park such as rides and attractions, and many more elements included below:
1. A **Newsletter** component
2. A **Image Carousell** Component to cycle featured images
3. **ocial Media links** that redirects the user
4. **Park Map** button that opens the pdf file
5. Clickable images that redirest user to relevant HTML pages

### [Attractions & Facilities Page]
Mainly goes into detail about what kind of facilities and attractions are available:
1. Info about **Food and activities**
2. Info about the Facilities such as **DinoCoaster** and **Triceratop Carousel**

All these information are organized neatly into a understandable and easy to access interface

### [Park Info Page]
A page where visitors can find out more information regarding the park, for example operating hours and contact info
- List the price of entry
- Operating hours and contact methods
- A FAQ corner is set up so that visitors is able to leave their messages to the park.
